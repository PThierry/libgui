The Graphic library
===================

This library is an easy to use, tile-based graphical interface manager. It aim
to support small screens with potential low refresh speed.

It permit to define tiles and menus, with easy to configure API for embedded
systems.

The current implementation of libGUI is compatible with the ili9341 TFT screen
driver and ad7843 touchscreen driver of the Wookey project, but can be easily
ported to other tft/touchscreen drivers, while the required primitives are
defined in the corresponding drivers.
